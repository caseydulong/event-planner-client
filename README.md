# Overview
This project is a front end, single page, event planner application utilizing a [Rails API](https://github.com/caseydulong/event-planner-api), also built by me.  The following technologies were utilized to realize this product:
- HTML
- SCSS
- Handlebars
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- AJAX

My initial idea was to make a tournament and event scheduler for the New England Super Smash Brothers community.  There is no official website for their organization, and they currently use a combination of a Facebook group and smash.gg for registrations and payment.

This was too large a project for me to undertake at time, so I decided to make a more general purpose event scheduler.  The app allows users to create and keep track of their own, personal events.

# Planning
The planning of this project consisted of several wireframes and ERDs, some user stories, and a rough outline of the order in which I planned to accomplish the required tasks.

## Wireframes and User Stories
A simple [wireframe](https://i.imgur.com/zxNoSwp.jpg) and set of user stories defined the first version I intended to create, which have all been fulfilled.
1. As a user I want to be able to create my own account.
2. As a user I want to be able to sign in and see my scheduled events.
3. As a user I want to be able to create new events for my calendar.
4. As a user I want to be able to update existing events on my calendar.
5. As a user I want to be able to delete existing events on my calendar.

## Future Features
- Clear forms on modal close (no submission).
- Add confirmation to event deletion.
- More polish for grid layout of event cards.
- Better formatting for event times.
- Better input fields for date and time.
- Better formatting or create and update event forms.
- Add multiple display sections for events (past events, public events, private events).
- Add search bar to search for your events by name.
- Add check box for all day time.
- Add check box for "one day only" events, so user won't need to enter the same date twice.
